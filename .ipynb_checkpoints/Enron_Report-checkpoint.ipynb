    "<p>Machine learning techniques were applied to data from 146 Enron employees.  There were 21 features for each employee and 3066 total data points.  The data for each employee fell into 3 categories: financial, email, and poi label.  The poi label signified whether or not an employee was a person of interest in the Enron case.  18 employees were labeled as a poi and 128 employees were not.  5 machine learning algorithms were deployed to predict an employee's poi label based on their financial and email features.  1 algorithm was selected and tuned for final analysis.</p>\n",
