The data for each employee fell into 3 categories: financial, email, and poi label.  The poi label signified whether or not an employee was a person of interest in the Enron case.  18 employees were labeled as a poi and 128 employees were not.  5 machine learning algorithms were deployed to predict an employee's poi label based on their financial and email features.  1 algorithm was selected and tuned for final analysis.</p>\n",

    "<p>Validation is important because it allows us to test our algorithms performance and avoid overfitting to the data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A decision tree algorithm was tuned using GridSearchCV.  Because GridSearchCV can do cross validation, the whole data set was passed to the algorithm instead of splitting the data into testing and training sets.  This is more useful because when data is split into train/test sets, the goal is to maximize the training set size to acheive the best learning outcome as well as maximize the test set size to acheive the best validation.  Partitioning the data like this caused a tradeoff because every data point used for the test set cannot be used by the training set and visa versa.  Cross validation partitions the data into bins of equal size and the learning experiment is run once for every bin in the set.  One bin is selected as the test set and the rest of the bins are selected for training.   This is done for every bin and the test results for each bin are averaged.  This takes more computing time but has better accuracy than training and testing sets.  The same data should not be used for both training and testing.  If a model fits to a training set and then tests on that same data then the model is not being tested or validated.</p>  \n",

    "\n",
    "<p>Poor parameter tuning can decrease the performance of the classifier.  It can also cause the classifier to overfit to the training data making it more difficult to perform well on the test data.  In the decision tree algorithm, the 'max_depth' parameter helps control the size of the tree.  This is important because if the tree gets too big the algorithm will overfit to the training data and have trouble validating on the test data.  The 'min_samples_split' parameter controls the number of samples at each node.  \"A very small number will usually mean the tree will overfit, whereas a large number will prevent the tree from learning the data.(sklearn documentation)\"  First, 'max_depth' was set to 3 while 'min_samples_split' was varied, then 'min_samples_split' was set to 5 while 'max_depth' was gradually increased.</p>\n",
